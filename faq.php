			<p class="question">I love your pictures! Do you have a store that I can come and see your pops?</p>
			<p class="answer">At this time, we don’t have a storefront. Our pops are created in a licensed 
			commercial kitchen and can be picked up or delivered.</p>
			
			<p class="question">delivery?! do you deliver?</p>
			<p class="answer">We do deliver. See “pricing” for delivery fees.</p>
			
			<p class="question">what about shipping?</p>
			<p class="answer">Please contact us about shipping. Some of our items can be shipped, many of the 
			delicately detailed items can not. Additionally, due to the perishable nature of the pops, all shipping 
			is required to be 1-day shipping. Please be advised that we do not offer ice packs or cooling devices 
			and shipping is at the buyers risk. </p>
			
			<p class="question">i’ve seen those infomercials for “cake pop makers”… can’t I just buy one of those and 
			make my own?</p>
			<p class="answer">the cake pops created by edibles by erin are not made like the cakes that come out of 
			the cake pop makers you see on TV.  The cake pops we make are baked cake that have been crumbled, blended 
			with frosting, and shaped into the preferred shape. This results in a rich flavor with “truffle-style” 
			consistency.</p>
			
			<p class="question">the place where I’m holding my event requires that outside treats come from a licensed 
			and insured bakery…. are you?</p>
			<p class="answer">yes! edibles by erin creates cake pops and goodies in a licensed commercial kitchen. We 
			are fully insured and are a licensed business.</p>
			
			<p class="question">i love your cake pops, but I’m not sure what I want! can you help me!?</p>
			<p class="answer">yes! Whether you have a vague idea or no idea at all, we can help create a beautiful, 
			personalized arrangement for you.</p>
			
			<p class="question">your cakepops are amazing! do you make anything else!?</p>
			<p class="answer">yes we do! We offer services to make full custom dessert tables, other goodies such as 
			chocolate pretzel sticks, dipped crispy rice treats,  brownie pops,  dipped marshmallows, homemade marshmallows, 
			homemade gumdrops and more! We also offer custom party table/decor services. Please contact us for more information</p>
			
			<p class="question">I have a wheat/nut/egg/dairy allergy. Can you create products that are guaranteed to be allergen free?</p>
			<p class="answer">Unfortunately at this time, edibles by erin can NOT guarantee that any items are allergen free. 
			Items are created in a facility and uses products that are exposed to all of the aforementioned allergens. 
			Please inform anyone consuming items purchased from edibles by erin that they are not guaranteed allergen free.</p>
			
			<p class="question">But, can you do gluten free or sugar free items?</p>
			<p class="answer">Please contact us for more information on this topic.</p>
			
			<p class="question">How far in advance do you need to place my order?</p>
			<p class="answer">We prefer as much time as possible in case specialty decorations need to be ordered. During the 
			holidays, or for large orders we need a minimum of 10 days prior to the event. Because we are a small business, 
			often times holidays will sell-out so be sure to get your order in early for high volume times!</p>
			
			<p class="question">But… my mother-in-law’s birthday is next week! She REALLY wants cake pops, help!</p>
			<p class="answer">call us, we will see what we can do.</p>
			
			<p class="question">How should I store them?</p>
			<p class="answer">Your cake pops are obviously made of perishable materials. We recommend not refrigerating 
			your cake pops until after you have presented them at your event. The reason for this is that (especially in 
			the summer) the cake pops going from cold to hot will cause them to sweat and sometimes the moisture causes little 
			spots on the cake pops. If you don’t mind little spots- refrigerate away! <br />
			We definitely recommend storing in a cool, dry place. Your cake pops are made with candy coating on the outside, so 
			they will melt in the heat.</p>
			
			<p class="question">Do you offer tastings?</p>
			<p class="answer">Please contact us about tastings. For large events (where 100+ pops will be ordered) we can 
			schedule a limited tasting after a deposit is secured.</p>
